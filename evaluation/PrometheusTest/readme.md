# Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Deployment Status Report



## Issue Summary

During the deployment, it was observed that some Prometheus targets are in a "down" state. This means that Prometheus is unable to scrape metrics from these targets. Consequently, the data collected and reflected in the `tested_promql_title.csv` file is incomplete, as it only contains data from the targets that are currently "up."



This report includes the following evidence to illustrate the deployment status:

1.  **Deployment Screenshots:**
    *   **image1.png:** This screenshot shows the terminal output during the deployment of the Prometheus and OpenTelemetry components. It provides a general overview of the deployment process.
    *   **image2.png:** This screenshot is another view of the terminal, possibly showing specific commands or logs related to the deployment.

2.  **Prometheus Target Health PDF Report:**
    *   **prometheus_target_health.pdf:** This PDF file contains a screenshot of the Prometheus web UI's "Targets" page. This page displays the health status of each configured target, indicating whether they are "up" or "down."
